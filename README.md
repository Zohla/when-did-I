# When Did I Last?

Rebuilt my task manager, (or should I say task observer) app with React 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### It's absolutely still a work in progress and is not even functional as a demo yet. 

## Dependencies
- react-router-dom

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
