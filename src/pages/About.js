        <p>Hi! My name is Maren and I'm a maker of things!</p>
        <p>
          I made this web app because I missed a low-pressure, low-maintenance
          task tracking app, and I wanted to challenge myself to build one.
        </p>
        <p>
          I always have a hundred things to do. But tracking every single task
          or having an app that constantly tells me that my tasks are overdue is
          just stressful.
        </p>
        <p className="contrast quote">
          "Sometimes I just want to know the last time I did something...that
          doesn't mean I'm gonna do it again right away."
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="italics"> When did I last?</span> makes it easier to
          prioritize because sometimes the sun is shining, and you really just
          have the time to change the sheets OR clean under the kids' beds.
        </p>
        <p className="italics">
          I started this project in May 2022 and still have features I'd like to
          add and styles I want to update.
